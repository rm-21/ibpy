# IBPY
An unofficial wrapper for the [Interactive Brokers Client Portal API](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/cpwebapi/). It's asynchronous!

# Requirements
* Preferrably, a running [`ibeam`](https://github.com/Voyz/ibeam) instance, or the Java client as described by IB [here](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/cpwebapi/quickstart)
